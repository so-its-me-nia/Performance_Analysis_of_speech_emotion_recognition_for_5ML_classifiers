# Performance_Analysis_of_speech_emotion_recognition_for_5ML_classifiers
The purpose of this project is to help choose the best machine learning classifier, for the 5 emotions of happy, sad, angry, fear and neutral. For audio samples where subjects (actors) are made to deliver sentences with various emotional undertones.

This project uses code from this GIT repo: https://github.com/x4nth055/emotion-recognition-using-speech
and tries improving accuracy by adding in more data and changing the emotions.

The datasets used are: 
1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess
3. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/surrey-audiovisual-expressed-emotion-savee
4. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piyushagni5/berlin-database-of-emotional-speech-emodb
5. Custom dataset provided in the code in the reference repository.

Dataset not included in the repository - since the file size is too large.

Hope this helps spark your interest in ML as it did in me :)
